# CppWebsite
---
This is a demo website backended by cplusplus

Those files are expected to run on a windows machine. If you are using a linux one, you are supposed to compile the two cpp files on your machine with g++ -std=c++11
Then put those files into the folder cgi-bin inside your apache httped.
View localhost/cgi-bin/index, then you get the website.
